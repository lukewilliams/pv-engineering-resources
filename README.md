### Cable Sizing

*   [DC Cable Sizing using AS/NZS 3008; and Limitations](https://www.gses.com.au/dc-cable-sizing-using-as-nzs-3008/) - An overview and examples of DC cable sizing using the standard AS/NZS 3008. Cable sizing is one of the most crucial engineering problems in PV system design. It has major implications on the overall cost, performance, and safety in design of PV systems. `January 11, 2021 by GSES` `#dc-cable` 
*   [Why do we need to derate electrical cables?](https://www.gses.com.au/why-do-we-need-to-derate-electrical-cables/) - This article looks at the physics behind why it is necessary to derate current carrying cables. `December 10, 2020 by GSES` 
*   [Aluminium vs Copper DC Cables](https://www.gses.com.au/aluminium-vs-copper-dc-cables/) - There are a number of disadvantages and additional requirements that must be considered in a design when comparing aluminium to copper. `May 2, 2019 by GSES`
*   [Specialised Cable Sizing of Complex Electrical Circuits](https://www.gses.com.au/specialised-cable-sizing-of-complex-electrical-circuits-as-nzs-3008-as-nzs-3008-1-1/) - In this article, we will compare the AS/NZS 3008.1.1 and IEC 60287 cable sizing and derating methods to solve the thermal current carrying capacity limits of selected cables. In doing so, we will illustrate the cases in which AS/NZS 3008.1.1 was designed to be used, where more detailed engineering solutions provide tailored inputs for site specific conditions, and provide a comparison between the two. `February 8, 2021 by GSES`

### Power Factor

*   [Power Factor and Grid Connected PV](https://www.gses.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GSES_powerfactor-110316.pdf) - This article explains what power factor is, what it is caused by, its impact on the grid, and how Grid Connected PV can both degrade and improve power factor in a system. `March 28, 2016 by GSES`
*   [Inverter Power Factor Modes: How do they affect voltage rise calculations?](https://www.gses.com.au/inverter-power-factor-modes/) - This article highlights the power factor modes requirements and voltage rise requirements, explains how voltage drop calculations is affected by enabling power factors, and demonstrates methods for carrying out the voltage rise calculations for different power factors as per AS/NZS 3008.1.1 :2017 Electrical installations—Selection of cables. `May 4, 2017 by GSES`

### System Layout Design

*   [A Case of Pitch: The effect of a North-South split pitch on array output and a rethink of optimum design](https://www.gses.com.au/a-case-of-pitch/) - To find out the exact effect of mounting arrays in different orientations, including incorporating south facing arrays in system design, GSES carried out an investigation using PVSyst to plot out the generation of north-south facing arrays, compared with east-west facing array. `November 30, 2018 by GSES`

### Isolator Sizing

*   [A Guide to AS/NZS 5033:2014 Amendment 2 Changes to Isolator Sizing](https://www.gses.com.au/a-guide-to-as-nzs-50332014-amendment-2-changes-to-isolator-sizing/) - AS/NZS 5033:2014 Amendment 2 changes to sizing isolators came into effect on 28th June 2019. The new requirements simplify the process of selecting an isolator and ensure that thermal effects are taken into account. It addresses fire risk issues and improves design and installation practices. `June 17, 2019 by GSES`

### Network & VPPs

*   [Implementing Virtual Power Plants (VPP) in Australia](https://www.gses.com.au/implementing-virtual-power-plants-vpp-in-australia/) - A virtual power plant (VPP) has the potential to make Australia’s grid infrastructure more resilient. Currently, VPPs can reduce the pressure on the grid during times of high demand. It does this by linking small-scale independent decentralised generators like PV systems and batteries into a network, with communication and controls to allow the units to act together like a conventional power station controlled by an operator. In the near future, VPPs might also have the ability to trade electricity when the wholesale electricity prices are high. `November 25, 2020 by GSES`
